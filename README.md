## Overview üìù

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of various machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. Each notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of a specific technique, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model building and evaluation. The primary dataset used across these projects is the classic Titanic dataset, offering a consistent basis for comparing the performance and application of different algorithms.

The goal of this repository is to showcase the practical implementation and working process of essential machine learning algorithms.

## üìÇ Project Structure

Each Jupyter Notebook in this repository is self-contained and focuses on a single machine learning algorithm. The structure of each notebook typically includes:

-   **Introduction:** A brief overview of the algorithm and its use case.
-   **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Importing the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing the data for modeling.
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the data to uncover patterns and insights.
-   **Model Implementation:** Building, training, and testing the machine learning model.
-   **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

## ‚öôÔ∏è General Workflow

A consistent workflow is applied in each notebook to ensure a clear and structured approach:

1.  **Data Preparation:** The Titanic dataset is loaded and cleaned. This includes imputing missing `Age` values and encoding categorical variables like `Sex` and `Embarked`.
2.  **Feature Selection:** Relevant features for predicting passenger survival are selected.
3.  **Train-Test Split:** The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
4.  **Model Training:** The specific machine learning algorithm is trained on the training data.
5.  **Prediction & Evaluation:** The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set, and its performance is evaluated.
